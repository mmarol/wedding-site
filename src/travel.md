                    country.</strong> While the e-visa application process is quick, we recommend reviewing the process
                ahead of time. Here is <a href="https://www.cgisf.gov.in/page/e-visa/">a useful resource</a> to get you

            <p class="page__description">Plan to fly into Bangalore International Airport (BLR). Travel to India from
                the US is long and time zone changes are disorienting! We recommend planning a day for travel and at
                least a day for recovery if possible. If possible, book your flights many months in advance. A lot of
                travel happens in the first week of the new year as it’s a very auspicious time, so prices will shoot up
                very rapidly.</p>

            <p class="page__description">Please make sure you are up to date on your vaccinations, and plan to carry N94
                or kN94 masks. Please do an at-home test before and after arrival. We highly encourage folks to wear
                masks to the events as there will be between 100-300 people depending on the event. Getting medical care
                in Bangalore will not be an issue as there are plenty of clinics and hospitals spread across the city.
