                are rapidly increasing.

                enter businesses or venues. Please do an at-home test before and after arrival. We highly encourage
                guests to wear masks to the events as some will be indoors and/or high volume. Testing supplies, masks,
                and medical care in Bangalore will be widely accessible as there are plenty of pharmacies, clinics, and
                hospitals spread across the city. If you need to purchase medical supplies in Bangalore, please bring
                your ID and vaccine documentation with you.

                <p class="page__description">India is a huge country, so if you’re planning on traveling outside of
                    Bangalore, we would suggest focusing on a specific part of the country instead of trying to hit
                    every sightseeing spot. Weather-wise, North India will be much colder than South India’s mild
                    winter. Note that if you visit any temples, your clothes should cover your arms and legs. Popular
                    destinations (flight/drive) are:

                    day to it. Some places to visit are:</p>

                    <li>Vidhana Soudha</li>
                    <li>Cubbon Park</li>

                <p class="page__description">Check out Rangashankara, Chowdaiah Memorial Hall, or Bangalore
                    International
                    Center for classical dance and music shows.</p>
                <p class="page__description">What Bangalore is good at is food and pubs. There is a wide variety of
                    cuisines available to suit every budget and palate. Bottled water would be safer, although
                    most restaurants serve filtered water. Explore & enjoy!</p>
                <p class="page__description">Shopping is another fun thing to do in Bangalore: clothes, crafts, jewelry,
                    fabrics, silk. Commercial Street, M.G. Road, Indiranagar, Jayanagar 4th Block and Chitrakala
                    Parishad are popular destinations for street-style shopping. There are many malls too.</p>
