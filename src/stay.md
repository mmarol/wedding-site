            <p class="page__description">The easiest way to travel around Bangalore would be to use ride sharing apps such as Uber and Ola, or to hail auto-rickshaws. Additionally, the Metro runs between some key parts of the city. Tourists can expect to largely navigate the city in English (with the help of some gestures). </p>
            <p class="page__description">Bangalore is a very large city with lots to do, but traffic can be very unpredictably brutal, so give yourself wide buffers when planning travel within the city. </p>
