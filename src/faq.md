You will also need to have your vaccine card on hand to enter businesses or venues. Please do an at-home test before and after arrival. We highly encourage guests to wear masks to the events as some will be indoors and/or high volume. Testing supplies, masks, and medical care in Bangalore will be widely accessible as there are plenty of pharmacies, clinics, and hospitals spread across the city. If you need to purchase medical supplies in Bangalore, please bring your ID and vaccine documentation with you.</p>
            <p class="page__description"><strong>If you are experiencing symptoms or test positive, please let us know and do not attend the events.</strong></p>
