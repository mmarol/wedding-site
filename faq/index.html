                Indian formal wear can be bought around the Indiranagar or MG Road neighborhoods.

                <strong>Reception</strong><br>
                <em>Formal</em><br>
                This would be something that you would wear to a nice dinner or cocktail party. Receptions in Indian weddings do not involve dancing, they are more of a mingling type of event.
            </p>
            <p class="page__description">
                Folks here tend to wear a different thing for each event, but there's no real pressure to do that. Something festive for the 2nd and formal for the 4th would be more than enough.
            </p>
            <p class="page__description">
                Fabindia (in Indiranagar) is a safe bet for most Indian clothing needs.

                3 cars that seat 6 people each will be organized to get everyone from the hotel to the various events, so please figure out amongst yourself how you’d like to split up between the cars.

                The events on the 2nd are around a 15-20 minute drive from the hotel. <br>
                The events on the 4th are a 30-45 minute drive.

        <div class="page__column">
            <p class="page__description">There is no real tipping culture in India, but 5-10% would be fine. At more everyday sit-down restaurants 20-30 ruppees, maybe 50 if you're feeling generous, would be more than enough. 20-30 for the hotel taxi would also be good. If the ATM doesn't give you small bills, grab a coffee when you exit the airport and break a 100.</p>

            <p class="page__description">
                For south indian “fast food” like dosa and idli, right on the other side of the street is a DVG Benne Dosa restaurant that should be great. We would recommend going there everyday and trying a couple new dishes. Make sure to get the coffee or tea at the end of the meal. Both come with milk and sugar, so you can't really get it black, but you can ask them for the sugar on the side usually.
                </p>
            <p class="page__description">
                A short drive from the hotel is also an MTR, a beloved South Indian fast food restaurant which has been around for a long time.

                Indiranagar in general has a ton of food and bar options.

            <p class="page__description">
                We would also highly recommend getting tender coconut water from any of the carts you see on the streets. It's between 20-40 ruppees and is one of the most refreshing things when you're walking around.

You will also need to have your vaccine card on hand to enter businesses or venues. Please do an at-home test before and after arrival.

Testing supplies, masks, and medical care in Bangalore will be widely accessible as there are plenty of pharmacies, clinics, and hospitals spread across the city. If you need to purchase medical supplies in Bangalore, please bring your ID and vaccine documentation with you.</p>
